       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Black Adam is not without its flaws, but i still enjoy the hell out of it, the problem that i have with Black Adam is that i never really buy all the Kahndaq people 100%, in the end i only still buy half of it, but i still fine with it, it's not like their characters are terrible, it just most of the time they are doing just a poor performance except the actress who played the mom and probably Ishmael for the most part, at least i still got some of the laughs from one of them, some of the slower scene was sometimes misplaced including some of the flashback, and some nit picky here and there, the rest of Black Adam is an exciting comic book film that fills with a very impressive battle that also fills with dazzling visual and cool style, Black Adam himself played incredibly well by Dwayne Johnson, he was just unstoppable in the most badass way, Justice Society has just become one of my favorite superhero team specifically in movies, they are fun and they are great, Hawkman, Doctor Fate, Cyclone, and Atom Smasher all of them are a hit for me, i love every single one of them, though i do wish they have something more with Doctor Fate because i think Pierce Brosnan was just unbelievably good playing the characters, again at least we do still have that one moment, i would love to see Justice Society again in movie maybe even their own movie, i would also love to have a specifically Doctor Fate standalone or a prequel film, and last but not least, the main villain, i think the main villain is doing as fine as most of the hero in the movie, so overall Black Adam is a quite a fun ride, 2 hours did feel quite goes by, an exciting back and forth battle that fills with dazzling visual effect and style, great score, great sound, great performances for most of the cast, being the first original DCEU movie that release in theaters only since WW84, Black Adam is not perfect but it's still great, it's still fun, it's still fascinating, it's still exciting, and i enjoy the hell out of it.</div>\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Black Adam is the perfect example of how inaccurate critics can be. By judging this movie by classic movies standards they end up pointing the obvious : wow it's just cgi fights after cgi fights.<br/><br/>What they don't get is that Black Adam is a very enjoyable piece of entertainment replicating perfectly the gleeful experience of reading a comic book.<br/><br/>This is the first superhero movie to emulate the extreme craziness of Michael Bay golden era. It's all there: the helicopter crash, the endless slow mo, the Dutch angles, the two minutes of dialogues sandwiched between fifteen minutes of explosions and of course the louder-the bass-the-better soundtrack.<br/><br/>And guess what? It works. Mostly.<br/><br/>Yes the Justice Society is a bunch of cosplayers with zero back story or character development but with dodgy priorities and powers that we've seen already in many superheroes before. But the effects are bold and spectacular, the colors wild, the camera moves astonishing. Add to it Zack Snyder's sepia tones, men in sandal obsession and anime like fights scenes (they reminded me of the best of Man Of Steel) and you have a very convincing \"comic book to screen\" adaptation.<br/><br/>Of course with this many new characters without a very precise goal most of the time, you end up with logistic issues where they just disappear offscreen during a fight for a little while and show up neatly when they have to. But that's because they all know they have to leave the room for the Rock whose statuesque figure was born for destroying fictional cities and throwing villain soldiers in the sky. Yeah that's the one thing Michael Bay wouldn't approve, you don't disrespect the military like that!</div>\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">In the superhero movie genre I would rank this somewhere in the middle, which of course also means that this is a fantastic movie from a DC-perspective. DC have really been digging below the bottom of the barrel, and with only one exception every other single movie have been horrible.<br/><br/>This is not horrible. Actually this is kinda entertaining, it is fun, and the movie flies by in a very brisk pace. The more or less constant fighting is pretty great, and they even manage to get a few one-liners in there. Even the CGi is good (mostly), which can only mean that DC finally got rid of their awful special effects team.<br/><br/>But this is not really great either. This is a very single-minded kind of movie. Evil bla bla bla curse lots of slow-mo accompanied by superhero bombastic music and lots of crashing buildings, lots of disposable henchmen. Sure there is a underlaying theme of \"who is really a hero?\" and a few tiny tidbits of story, but mainly this is like a huge wrestling match with pretty unpretentious smashing. Since everything move so quickly we also have no time to breath or get to know these characters. I wish there was 20min more with some background stories, but nah, smash more, blow up more stuff, woosh, blam, slam.<br/><br/>If you have no intention of seeing anything but a big long slugfest with a lot of CGi and you do not care about story or character development, then you are likely going to love this. From that perspective, and from a DC perspective, this movie is pretty good, almost great. But if you weigh in actual movie value such as script, characters, and storytelling well... then not so much.<br/><br/>I give this a 7/10 just because I was entertained and since I am happy to see a DC film that do not suck like a boring black hole. But to be honest that score is too generous. Worth the ticket price though; so I recommend!</div>\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">No, the hierarchy of power in the DC universe did not change with the introduction of \"Black Adam\". This was a very mediocre film, and felt like a very colour by numbers superhero film, designed and tested to please as many audiences as possible. Meaning it plays it safe and doesn't take any risks. But I enjoyed it, it's a very entertaining watch with lots of huge setpieces! In fact, once it gets going it doesn't stop... it's a non-stop, action-packed thrill ride! It's only problem - it's so average; something we've seen a million times before. It almost left me feeling a bit of superhero fatigue, as everything just felt recycled. I kept waiting for it to do something fresh and new, and while there were a few good moments, overall the movie was incredibly predictable. I even had moments wishing the action would slow down so we could get another dialogue scene or something that would flesh out the characters more. The script just isn't great, frankly. But it's still a good time. I think of it like this; Black Adam is a bad movie held together by some AWESOME moments!<br/><br/>So let's get these negatives out of the way. The script is extremely weak and very predictable, heck the trailers even spoiled a \"twist\" near the middle of the film. It's not hard to figure out what the movie is doing, especially for those of us who've seen a lot of these superhero movies over the years. It doesn't try all that hard to keep eventual reveals hidden, as it's more focused on giving its protagonist the flashiest, most murder-filled debut in the DCEU (even though I would look to \"The Suicide Squad\" for that). It really felt like the creative team saw Black Adam being an anti-hero as an excuse to let them have the character kill everyone. It felt so overplayed and obnoxious, like they were trying to say \"see look how brutal we can make this\" without actually earning the audience's investment. The scenes where Black Adam just goes around dominating everyone just felt empty, like sure it was cool to see him be so powerful and instantly kill people, but it took all the tension out of the scenes. It felt like they were beating me over the head with \"look how powerful and ruthless he is\". The novelty of it wore off very quickly too, so thank god the film introduces the Justice Society pretty quick! They did make the smart choice of making this equal parts a Justice Society film as they did a Black Adam film, and I gotta say while I did find the character of Black Adam quite interesting, it was the Justice Society (mainly Hawkman and Doctor Fate) that I loved!<br/><br/>It's when the Justice Society comes in that the movie remembers how fun exciting superhero stories can be. I enjoyed their part in the story the most, and instantly loved the characters. Pierce Brosnan's Doctor Fate was awesome, it was so cool to see Brosnan in a superhero role. He did feel a little reminiscent of a certain Marvel Doctor, but that's okay because they both have some COOL scenes; Fate had some of the most memorable in the film! Hawkman was also pretty badass, I really hope to see these characters again! And I gotta say, I did love Dwayne Johnson as Black Adam. He suits the role very well and I'd love to see this iteration of the character return. I'm just not sure how I feel about him in this movie. It makes him look cool and all, and Johnson's physique is perfect for the character, but he had almost no story. Like they introduced his backstory and everything, but once the movie got going it never stopped to examine his character; we never understood how he felt about anything, which made him just come across as an uncharming sociopath. This is especially unusual for Johnson, as we all know how undeniably charismatic he can be, and he just isn't here. But damn he sure is magnetic and does command the screen with his hulking form and brooding looks. The only cast members I didn't like, and this was more because of the way their characters were written, were Adrianna and her son. They really did not work for me and made some really dumb decisions throughout the movie, and had some very cringey scenes. But luckily that was only a minor part! There was some cool cameos too, surprisingly from James Gunn's \"The Suicide Squad\" and of course a certain cast member from \"Shazam!\". I did love these little connections- it's nice to see the DCEU try to be interconnected again! And the \"Shazam!\" stuff was awesome, it showed some things I wished we got to see in that movie! And how could I forget... There was one other cameo I did really love. It's definitely the worst kept secret in Hollywood... but made for an awesome end credit scene and made this fan very happy!<br/><br/>The filmmaking here is abysmal. Jaume Collet-Serra has never made a great movie, instead making B-level movies at the studio level... and this might just be proof he is not capable of directing films of this scale. He makes every moment feel mundane; from Black Adam going on a killing spree to the big fight between the JSA and Black Adam, these moments should feel engaging and cool, but instead just bored me, frankly. It feels like he is trying so hard to show spectacle, but he ultimately fails, making it all feel cheap and generic. I also couldn't stand the cinematography. It seems like they shot the film to look like Zack Snyder's \"300\", with bland colours and lots and lots of annoying slo-mo. At least the CGI was good! There were some moments that had their flaws, but overall this movie has some awesome CGI (and a seemingly obligatory CGI filled 3rd act). Don't even get me started on the truly awful sound mix, it just felt like sound was being blared in my face for 2 hours and I couldn't discern what I was hearing. It just sounded messy. The score isn't memorable, instead it just sounds like a jumble of notes and digital instrumentation, it has no emotional core to the music and it is just noise. Even the dialogue is not mixed well, but that's okay because the dialogue is horrendous anyways.<br/><br/>So why, after all that complaining, did I ultimately enjoy myself while watching? Well, because it has enough cool moments that I came out satisfied. I have never seen a movie so bad that I still enjoyed this much. It's remarkable how well a few moments and ideas can make for an enjoyable viewing experience. The disappointing part of this is, if only they put the good moments together in better ways this could have been an awesome film, but instead it misses so many opportunities. There was one moment that really stands out to me because it made me want to cheer however, and that was the awesome reference to \"The Good, The Bad and the Ugly\", I feel like many superhero fans will miss that reference, but for me as a cinephile that scene quickly became my favourite in the film! The film felt like it was made in the 90s, before the MCU, before X-Men, before superhero flicks became popular back when they were still trying to figure them out, it was just all over the place. And it also happened to be pretty derivative of other films- \"Avatar\", \"Black Panther\" and \"Captain America: The First Avenger\" especially. But despite all my issues I have with this film - and I have many - it somehow still managed to entertain me and leave me satisfied by the time it was over (possibly because of the awesome end-credit scene). It was kind of like \"Venom\"... just some mindless superhero fun! I wish it was a better movie because it did have some awesome elements, but as a film it ultimately fails. I would like to see more of Dwayne Johnson's \"Black Adam\", especially in a potential \"Black Adam v. Superman\" movie he keeps talking about! With some improvements, it could be a much better movie than this, while still being entertaining!</div>\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I knew nothing of Black Adam going in so it was pretty cool to discover who he is and what he's about. This is a fast-paced and fun movie with some good action scenes. The musical score is great, and of course it's composed by beast Lorne Balfe who has become a star. I like the cast and was pretty happy with the 300-feel it gave me a few times.<br/><br/>This movie is also flawed. Not everything works. Much of the comedy doesn't hit. There is a bunch of basic dialogue. It's not a good sign when I can predict the next line multiple times.<br/><br/>There seems to be a LOT stolen from Marvel. I'm not a comic book guy and have no stakes in the Marvel vs DC debate. I don't know which of these characters were created first. But the four side-heroes are all analogous to Marvel characters we've already seen in movies for years. We have an Ant-man, a Doctor Strange, a Falcon and a Storm (sort of). I'll give them props for the last two possibly being cooler than their Marvel counterparts. But it wasn't just the characters, there were at least four moments that reminded me of something from a Marvel movie.<br/><br/>I tried not to let that factor into my feelings for the movie. And even with this slightly positive DC chapter, I continue to hope that DC can do better. I know they can. The Dark Knight trilogy is still GOAT and I love the first three movies after that. I really hope they can do better in the future. (1 viewing, opening Thursday UltraScreen 10/20/2022)</div>\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">\"Black Adam\" is the 11th film in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) and a spin-off from 2019's \"Shazam!\". Starring Dwayne Johnson in the title role, it delivers explosive action scenes with great special effects that should satisfy fans of the superhero genre.<br/><br/>Five thousand years after being bestowed with the power of ancient gods and then sealed away, Teth-Adam (Dwayne Johnson) is released from his prison in the modern day city of Kahndaq. Shocked at how much the world has changed, Adam goes on a rampage, brutally killing many hostile soldiers and other adversaries in the process. In an attempt to quell Adam's rage, the Justice Society of America (JSA), consisting of Doctor Fate (Pierce Brosnan), Cyclone (Quintessa Swindell), and Atom Smasher (Noah Centineo) set off for Kahndaq to halt this senseless destruction before it is too late.<br/><br/>Since his comic book debut back in 1945, Black Adam (a.k.a. Teth-Adam or Theo Adam) has been depicted as both a hero and a villain at various points. In recent years, however, he has been reworked as an anti-hero, retaining his violent streak while also wishing to help out the less fortunate wherever possible. The character's sudden acquisition of superpowers lends itself to the idea that owning such inhuman strength also runs the risk of misuse and corruption along with it. This concept certainly pushes the typical \"with great power comes great responsibility\" formula to the limits and in this 2022 film about the titular character, we now get to see that notion play out for us in live-action.<br/><br/>I have to admit it's quite refreshing to see a superhero film where its main character is neither good nor bad but rather a neutral party in all of this. So often in these types of stories we watch as our protagonist simply acquires his or her powers and immediately goes off to do heroic or villainous deeds without a second thought. Here, we get to see Black Adam come to terms with what powerful abilities he has unwillingly been given, undecided as to what allegiance he falls under. In one scene, we see Adam mercilessly slaughter armed soldiers one by one, literally reducing some of them to ashes but shortly afterwards he saves the lives of a young boy and his mother caught in the crossfire. The ambiguity as to whom Adam wants to protect versus whom he wants to kill becomes a common theme throughout the movie, which does a nice job of making you wonder what battles he's going to pick and choose.<br/><br/>To compliment these internalised conflicts, we also have some highly entertaining action scenes to go along with them. In addition to the aforementioned fights against soldiers, there's extensive gunfire and explosive weaponry frequently used against Adam during battle, of which proves futile in the end. These moments helped move the film along at a brisk pace, leaving little room for anything boring to transpire. Of course, as is usually the case in most superhero films, there is so much collateral damage left in the wake of scenes like these. As fun to watch as these parts were, I couldn't help but feel a little sorry for the poor people of Kahndaq as their city is subject to so much destruction throughout the chaos. It's just as well Kahndaq is a fictional place because I hate to imagine how costly it would be in real life to rebuild everything that was destroyed in the melee. This may seem like a trivial nitpick, but considering how ancient the city is supposed to be, it feels kind of painful to see so many things of historical value smashed to pieces for the sake of an action setpiece.<br/><br/>As the film is a spin-off from \"Shazam!\", one of the more amusing entries in the DC Extended Universe, there's also some light-hearted comic relief to ease the tension of certain serious scenes. While the jokes were rather hit-and-miss and didn't always land, the ones that did provided some much needed humorous moments, showing yet again that DC films are capable of being funny whenever they want to be. In particular, I liked the scenes where Adam tries to comprehend modern day lexicon when compared to how things were over five thousand years ago. I suppose it is similar to how Thor tried to blend in with the humans in the MCU, only this time with the more sinister undercurrent of Adam turning rogue at any time.<br/><br/>It seems long overdue that Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson play a superhero/supervillain in a comic book movie and now we finally get to see him do just that. Given his muscular physique, a character like Black Adam suits Johnson perfectly. It's great fun to see Johnson put his strength as a former wrestler to good use as he throws his enemies across ridiculous distances, not once caring where they might land. At the beginning, I half expected him to be constantly spouting lame one-liners and pulling weird reaction faces at strange scenarios, but for the most part Johnson plays the role very seriously. You certainly gain a solid understanding of why he doesn't consider himself neither good nor bad, which made his character a more compelling anti-hero. That's not to say he's always downbeat, because he definitely has his fair share of comical moments from time to time.<br/><br/>The rest of the supporting cast were decent, with Quintessa Swindell and Noah Centineo fitting in reasonably well as Cyclone and Atom Smasher, respectively, but only Pierce Brosnan as Doctor Fate left any lasting impression on me. His character appears to be the Doctor Strange of the DCEU (though Fate's comic debut predates Strange's creation by 23 years), summoning spells and incantations that allow him to stand head-to-head with Black Adam during his violent rampages. Unlike Strange, however, Fate doesn't have an inflated ego and is relatively level-headed and calm, much like a certain famous spy Brosnan has played in the past. To be fair though, Dwayne Johnson is a hard act to outshine due to his natural charisma so if there's any actor in this film who comes close, it would be the one who used to play James Bond.<br/><br/>Taking into consideration the current state of the DCEU, an entry like \"Black Adam\" doesn't really offer anything better or worse than what we've already experienced many times before. It works simply as an entertaining, action-packed, effects-driven superhero film that will hopefully keep fans happy for two whole hours. I am curious to see how Black Adam will be integrated among the other DC heroes, especially with the ones from \"Shazam!\", but for now he works just fine as a standalone character. However, judging by the mid-credits scene, things do look promising.<br/><br/>I rate it 7.5/10.</div>\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Black Adam is the latest film in the DCEU, and boy, it packs a punch. Explosions, flying superheroes, magic, lightning and beautiful armour follows the Justice Society, and of course Black Adam.<br/><br/>The film centers around a god-like ancient human being who was gifted his powers in a time of darkness and enslavement. After being defeated and unseen for over a 5000 years, he returns, his goal being unknown. With the powers he has a group of superheroes, the Justice Society, deems him to be a threat, and performs an attempt to lock him up, unknown of the real danger.<br/><br/>It is better than people say. Although at first glance it seems to be a film simply made for the action and explosions, it does have a story, strong dialogues and character development. The visual effects are astonishing in every single way, and people who have watched Avengers: Endgame will love the visuals in this film.<br/><br/>My personal rating? A 10/10. My rating based on realism, plot and other factors? An 8 or a 9/10. If I'm going to be honest, the worst thing about this film was some unrealism like characters being able to survive a lot more than possible, and some being quite dumb in terms of their actions.<br/><br/>As for my conclusion: Black Adam is a great, visually wonderful film with lots of action violence and lovable characters. Watch it in the cinema for a lifetime experience.</div>\n",

Hawkman,Black Adam are the badass in this film. Dwayne Johnson is really born to play this character and watch out for the mid credit scene!.<br/><br/>This is the movie for a great momentum for the future of DC universe.<br/><br/>At the negative side, villain is not intimidating and storyline is repetitive and there some cheesy scenes but overall this movie is a blast.<br/><br/>So excited for the future of dceu. 7.5/10.</div>\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">For a while here there's a sense that DC, on one of its few and far between occasions, has managed to deliver a feature film product worthy of its source material (and extensive budgets) with director Jaume Collet-Serra managing to start Black Adam in a fun and exciting fashion that seems to suggest audience goers were going to be treated to something a little unexpected, something just slightly amended from the usual playbook of initial superhero adventures but then all hope and excitement is extinguished by a teenage boy and his ever-present skateboard.<br/><br/>More on that later.<br/><br/>A much-hyped production that its leading man has been championing for the better part of the last few years, Black Adam presents DC with one of its greatest chances yet to bring one of its more complicated creations to screen and while his natural charisma (that you either love or hate) is mainly squashed in a role that brings to mind Arnie from Terminator 2, Dwayne Johnson fits the bill to be our anti-hero Teth Adam but despite some impressively staged early action scenes and a narrative that doesn't always play to the rules set out for large blockbuster origin stories such as this, Black Adam is unable to keep the foot on the gas as some questionable narrative decisions and character inclusions halt much of the films progress in being a silly but fun popcorn munching ride.<br/><br/>There are times here when you forget you're watching a Black Adam film with Bodhi Sabongui and Sarah Shahi's Kahndaq natives Adrianna and Amon Tomaz joining Adam's journey as he awakens from a 5000 year slumber to all of a sudden be battling unknown forces and Aldis Hodge's Hawkman led Justice Society, with these two characters playing large roles in proceedings to an extent they become a genuine annoyance and by the time Amon is rallying local citizens in one of the most cringe-worthy battle cries committed to celluloid before leading a charge on his beloved skateboard you know that Black Adam has failed to hit the mark.<br/><br/>These glaringly non-important characters and plot diversions do in some ways mask other problems that become more apparent as Black Adam's runtime wears on with Collet-Serra's insistence on including either a blasting musical score or Spotify 101 pump up songs in all of his abundant slow-mo action scenes or a collection of underdeveloped characters that includes the films main villain and Justice Society members Atom Smasher and Cyclone other reasons why the film fails to go on with its various moments of promise, with one almost wishing we were allowed more time to get to know Adam or even Pierce Brosnan's Dr. Fate/Kent Nelson, who steals many of the films best scenes with one hoping the veteran screen actor gets a chance to shine in a solo outing in the near future.<br/><br/>To be fair to all involved, Black Adam is far from the worst DC movie to come our way but in regards to promise and potential verses the final outcome, this loud, colourful and soulless outing is equivalent to the likes of Man of Steel and Suicide Squad as features that seemed to be set to shine only for poor decisions and weak directive decisions hampering any chance they had of shining on the big stage.<br/><br/>Final Say -<br/><br/>Not without its moments, Black Adam is hampered by an increasingly painful plot-line and even worse supporting characters that take away from the films early signs that it is looking to do something a little different than the usual origin story run-through.<br/><br/>2 1/2 skateboards out of 5.<br/><br/>Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)</div>\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Director Juame Collet-Serra's extensive experience helming thriller films is quite evident here; the action-while not particularly distinctive-is more than sufficiently hard-hitting, gleefully destructive, and thrilling to keep the film from ever becoming dull.<br/><br/>That's quite the achievement, because on paper Black Adam is a largely dull exercise. It's entirely derivative of other, better superhero films, and is without an ounce of any sense of originality in what it delivers to this corpse of a genre.<br/><br/>The film has a villain who is never really introduced until the final act and is laughably cartoonish. He's a punching bag for the characters to have something to fight at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>The ordinary mortal characters are just as lifeless. Most of the people in this movie aren't actual living, breathing human beings, but plot devices.<br/><br/>That being said, The Rock's titular character of Black Adam is actually handled surprisingly well. His background of tragedy is thoroughly explored (even though it's through clunky narration exposition dumps), and does undergo tangible internal change over the course of the story.<br/><br/>Adam's change in self-image has moderately thought-provoking implications as he comes to realise that his past failures don't determine currency worthiness.<br/><br/>This is one of only two bright spots in the writing, along with watching Adam and Hawkman clash in their worldviews/opinions of justice.<br/><br/>I really do wish that these bright spots made up more of the movie. Because the entire plot is constructed solely of story beats and objects and antagonists who have not only been seen before, but have been seen before so often-and exactly in this way-that they've been beaten more than any deceased horse.<br/><br/>Consequently, it's a sometimes charming, largely competent exercise in rote rehash.</div>\n",

I didn't really have any expectations for this movie, as the only real knowledge I have about the character comes from the Injustice video game series. However, Black Adam takes all the elements of bad superhero flicks and crams them into one loud &amp; messy movie. While it does have some exciting action sequences, it also had too many characters, not enough backstory, heavy-handed messages, bad acting, forced humor, sloppy editing, awful dubbing, and an overreliance on CGI. I spent the first half of the movie confused, and the second half annoyed.</div>\n",

Maybe there are people who were, but as for myself and the people I know, Black Adam was just yet another superhero movie in an unending line of superhero movies; all the same with nothing new or fresh to offer. But still, as is custom, I had to go check this movie out because Sri Lanka's roster of theater releases aren't that great, so I'll take whatever comes.<br/><br/>Black Adam ended up being sometimes funny, a little more than sometimes cringe, and extremely mid. It's a movie with the most generic stakes ever, and with nothing new to add to a genre that has been the same for the past few years. The only aspect I personally enjoyed in the movie was Pierce Brosnan, and sometimes The Rock, but everything else fell flat. Especially whatever the writers tried to do with the Amon character. Things couldn't have been more generic than that.<br/><br/>Overall, is it a bad movie? Far from it. Is it good? NO. Should you watch it? Well, you wouldn't be missing anything if you didn't.</div>\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Black Adam is a superhero movie's superhero movie: and it seems like critics and audiences (even though they're both one and the same most of the time) are becoming evermore divided on what one group thinks about the productions in question. Yes the film's cliched, yes the characters don't exactly have depth to them through most of the movie, yes the CGI evokes Star-Wars-Prequel-Trilogy-Ragdoll-Physics or 2000s-Ragdoll-Physics, but Dwayne Johnson is such an entertainingly stoic action-man that it's like he's playing an unironic parody of action movies that it just goes with the flow of its own self-aware sense of Hollywood-isms.<br/><br/>Black Adam is an origin story, a team-up movie, a villain showcase, and somewhat confused in its fan-service like the LITERAL POSTERS of the Wonder Woman movie, Batman-comic-accurate-artwork, Superman merchandise, Injustice toys (from the video games), and the Suicide-Squad-style intro to our supporting characters makes you wonder... is DC Films self-aware of its success AND shortcomings in the past, and is just throwing everything into a blender with these shared-universe movies? If so: interesting choice. It doesn't work for 'serious cinema' necessarily, but it's a nice approach that can certainly be refined. Just... have the fourth-wall-breaking-fan-service make sense in the story; please?<br/><br/>Anywho: Black Adam has FINALLY been released after years of false-starts, Tweets, and studio-reshuffling to make even seasoned studio executives perplexed, and 2022 has Black Adam... breaking away from Shazam entirely. The two were originally gonna be in the Shazam! Movie. Makes you wonder if it should've stayed that way? At least they're finally in cinema: and now they can breathe in sequels I suppose.<br/><br/>This movie may not be what some of the fans are expecting, but the fan-service on display does work (when it makes sense) and the action can be a sight to behold, and the leading man himself knows how to rock the spandex look absolutely. The screenplay is a confused mess scared of the antihero theme making 'The Rock' look like a villain; so they sprinkle conflicted protagonist and boom, Black Adam's now a superhero. 3/5 stars.<br/><br/>For all that doesn't work in the film, the stuff that does keeps it from becoming downright tedious thankfully. When it's action-heavy it's action-heavy. With the fan service it's going all the way when it can. Just don't expect the story to break your minds or something. It's fairly straightforward stuff: and maybe that's what is bothering the critics.</div>\n",

Literally poor direction , most of place felt rushed , clumsy and incomplete . Action sequence was topnotch , with good choreography and marvelous visuals . Humor worked well in few places . More than Black Adam we can only see Dwayne Johnson . Comparing to others Doctor Fate was pretty impressive . Antagonist didn't create much impact . Cast done their job well . Technically , VFXs and cinematography were good , editing was average .<br/><br/>Overall a jus watch it for action sequence and mid credit scene 🔥 , if you can digest some cringe .</div>\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Since around late 2019, I have boycotted all superhero movies all that noise all that endless repetitive fighting that achieves little. However, as the Rock was the star of this one I thought I would try it out. Dwayne Johnson is one of those none actors like Arnie before him who seem to play themselves in every movie but yet it works. So what would the Rock add to Black Adam?<br/><br/>Sadly not much, I am afraid I found this bad boy anti-hero dull and uninteresting and I was yawning for the end long before the final round of action stuff which as we all know the good guys always win, but could they not do it in a neat 90 minutes but at least this one was over in 124 though it felt much more like 180. One more observation I thought much of the special effects looked distinctly average perhaps this is a budget, superhero.<br/><br/>If it cost $100 million it must be Hollywood inflation. I love the movies at the movies, and so I will be back but not for Black Adam 2 but for the next hopefully decent Dwayne Johnson action movie.</div>\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Black Adam (2022) is a movie my wife and I saw in theaters last night. This storyline follows an ancient being known as Black Adam awaken within some ancient ruins. There is a race to find a historical crown that contains demon powers that is tied to how Black Adam gained his powers. As Black Adam's chaos begins he gains the attention of the Justice Society that will try to contain Black Adam while also thwarted the evil doers trying to get the crown. The question becomes which side will Black Adam take, the side of the evil doers or join forces with the Justice Society?<br/><br/>This movie is directed by Jaume Collet-Serra (Orphan) and stars Dwayne Johnson (The Rundown), Aldis Hodge (Hidden Figures), Pierce Brosnan (Tomorrow Never Dies) and Mohammed Amer (Mo).<br/><br/>It's impossible not to like a super hero movie with this many kill scenes. The Rock is absolutely awesome as Black Adam and his kill scenes are tremendous as are the running jokes tied to the killings. The comedic content overall is pretty solid. The special effects are tremendous and I enjoyed the inclusion of the Justice Society. Aldis Hodge delivers a strong performance as does Jalon Christian (A Journal for Jordan). The storyline is intricate and has some fun twists and turns and I enjoyed the conclusion. The post credits scenes is absolutely awesome too.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a very well done addition to the super hero genre with enough unique elements to make it a must see. I would score this a strong 7.5-8/10 and strongly recommend it.</div>\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Admittedly far from impressive, doesn't reinvent the wheel and writing wasn't so great, but I loved it still. My feelings kept changing before it's release, compared to the days I was excited for it, it didn't deliver as much, but if compared to the days I was scared it was gonna flop then Black Adam was actually way better than my expectations.<br/><br/>The first scenes of the movie are great, sorta reminds me of mythical movies like clash of the titans or Hercules in which Dwayne Johnson featured in too. Not many movies like that being made, we went from gladiator movies to Greek god movies, somewhere in between had Egyptian mummies and now we're in a superhero phase. Still think superhero movies are awesome fun, even better when done right but I loved gods and mythical movies, and this puts them both together.<br/><br/>It has an almost dark ambience to it but is still visually stunning with Cyclone and Atom smasher giving it a more prismatic feel. They also had a little side plot going that actually didn't get anywhere. Compared to other recent movies, I love that Black Adam's origin was handled in a God Butcher-esque way, it was dark enough to still keep it dark while still keeping a pg13 rating which I thought should've been higher before release.<br/><br/>It also blends Black Adam's Bronze Age origins and magic with future tech. If you're more of a fan of the cinematic universes and don't really read the comics, the movie does it's best to give you a background introduction, but because of this the first part of the movie feels rushed because it's a lot to condense into the start. Don't really read the comics so I don't know if they did Black Adam's character justice for the comic fans.<br/><br/>Adams intro in the movie so good, and his main adversary's was even better later on, actually devilish. I love how when DC super-powers someone, they really go for it and people really hated it with Henry Cavil's Superman. I love the idea of them potentially getting into a brawl in the future.<br/><br/>Action is superb once it starts, delivers on expectations although the movie almost leans a lot on it's action. I also recommend avoiding spoilers and trailers as I did. Loved how Black Adam's sternness is written to some comedic effect at times, I often say Hollywood shouldn't try making every new superhero movie into a joke show and they kept it in a low here.<br/><br/>Dwayne Johnson was great and did his character justice, so did Pierce Brosnan as Dr fate, I think Noah Centineo and Quintessa Swindell suffered from being underwritten side characters due to so much plot and other characters the movie had to fit in, so they didn't get as much time to shine. If there was an award for most cameos in the same movie... I also feel like black Adam was written perfectly but at the end started making mannerisms that broke from his character, like the smirking and smiles.<br/><br/>The actual problems I had with the movie were once the premise is revealed the story progresses generically, so you can pretty much figure out where the story is going. It's pretty formulaic and the story narration wasn't something to behold. For that reason, as much as I still love it, it's not as good as it could've been, it does deliver on shifting the power dynamics in the dceu though. And with all the great action and cast coupled with decent story, it's still a fun watch. Secondly, something I rarely say, it could've been better if it was longer to let the story develop and add depth; because it has the makings of a great movie and really finds it's footing in the third act but then blitzes quickly through it to the end.<br/><br/>And it promises a lot for the future, I hope future DC movies are more coherent like what MCU does by making their movies relate, not just having heroes cameoing in other heroes movies then bunching them all together. This could be a great start to a phase in the DC universe, could argue it started with Shazam but you get it.<br/><br/>It's imperfect and has wiggle room for improvement but I love it and would recommend seeing it on the big screen. Deadpool has been my favorite antihero for a long time and is a whole different character but I think black Adam's taking that spot now. I loved the movie for Black Adam's character himself.</div>\n",

Adding some ethnic flavor to his accent would've paid off mightily.<br/><br/>Carrying echoes of Snyder but with the treatments and levity of the Wonder Woman and Aquaman entries to the DCEU, Black Adam hits the right notes and solidifies that the DCEU is alive and well.<br/><br/>Unless you've been living under a rock, make sure to stick around for the post-credit scene.<br/><br/>Solid 8/10.</div>\n",

The same Snyder-esque template (endless slow mo, dirty/dark palette). Dr. Fate copies literally every move from Dr. Strange. Hawkman annoying as hell with his bland brand of \"leadership\".

A simple entertaining film if you're able to see past some of its obvious faults. The action really felt like it was trying to be Zack Snyder lite, which partially works because it only tries to be lite in using that style even though the movie itself is action-packed. The characters are very forgettable although the performances of Pierce Brosnan, Aldis Hodge and the rest of the Justice Society members gives some life to it. The music was very underwhelming for me especially because it tries to elevate scenes by becoming loud and noticeable without making any impact.<br/><br/>Black Adam is supposed to be an antihero but with a star like The Rock, he is only a reluctant hero who doesn't mind killing. Overall just a watchable film if you're a fan of the superhero genre.</div>\n",

This is a movie I probably won't remember at all in the near future. Too much slo-mo and lack of fun. Pierce Brosnan was probably the highlight as he gives the film a little bit of a spark to the cast of characters.<br/><br/>Otherwise very dull characters which you care little about, wonky special effects in places and humour which doesn't work most of the time. Dwayne Johnson has little charisma in this film and I simply didn't care what happened. This was overall kinda bad honestly.<br/><br/>3.5/10.</div>\n",

I always wondered why Black Adam? Not just an obscure Comic book character amongst DC's finest but why not just play his best rival SHAZAM and truly be a black superhero?<br/><br/>I have to say, I'm so happy he picked Black Adam. Mostly because Dwayne Johnson playing a \"Villain\" met that superheroes would have to try to stop him, and they made the decision to...extend the DC Extended Universe with heroes that have not grace the silver screen yet.<br/><br/>Aldis Hodge playing a cross between Batman and Black Panther with his version of Hawkman. The special effects to bring Atom Smasher to life were amazing, now I know who Cyclone is (I wonder if she's an actual black woman in the comic), and Pierce Brosnan, who could have been my generation's Batman, is playing Dr. Faith. Forming together to become the Justice Society and me hoping this will not be the last I see of them.<br/><br/>Black Adam was good it was really good, absolutely worth the time and effort. The DC Extended universe has made some questionable movies, but this is not one of them. This was Aquaman, Wonder Woman good. This was SHAZAM good, and that's hope that battle with Black Adam is coming up!<br/><br/>Excellent!!</div>\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">\"The new era\" for the DCEU is here, but sadly, it's not quite the jump in quality the cinematic universe truly needed.<br/><br/>The introduction of Black Adam is flawed as many of the previous DCEU movies have been, and there are no notable changes in direction that make it stick out in its own way. The movie fails to find a unique mark and doesn't really have anything interesting to say.<br/><br/>If everything you want from a superhero movie is the action, you got it, also sometimes the CGI feels overused. Try to go any deeper than that, and there's not much else to be found.<br/><br/>Best part of the movie must be Brosnan's Doctor Fate, but he can't carry the whole movie just by the look of his character. There needs to be a story...a good one, which is missing here.<br/><br/>There's not much that can be said about the film's villain, Sabbac, without spoiling the film. However, even if spoilers weren't an issue, there's still basically nothing interesting to say about him.<br/><br/>Even with all that said, given how big Dwayne Johnson is and how much power he seems to have over the franchise (and now the DCEU as well), fans should expect Black Adam to carry on in a big way going forward for better or for worse. New hierarchy they said? Yeah. No.</div>\n",

It has everything you need for a super hero movie.<br/><br/>A great cast. In particular Pierce Brosnan. It's good to see him return to the big screen in such an iconic role.<br/><br/>An original script.<br/><br/>Amazing action scenes.<br/><br/>You can tell that the movie was more than ten years in the making based on its attention to detail in the production. Starting from the special effects up to the costume designs.<br/><br/>I don't know much about the original comic or the DC universe in general. But I love the idea of an anti-hero saving the world on its own terms. This grittier and darker approach totally works for me and could be a door opener for a whole new sub-genre. Good times!</div>\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Black Adam is the perfect example of how inaccurate critics can be. By judging this movie by classic movies standards they end up pointing the obvious : wow it's just cgi fights after cgi fights.<br/><br/>What they don't get is that Black Adam is a very enjoyable piece of entertainment replicating perfectly the gleeful experience of reading a comic book.<br/><br/>This is the first superhero movie to emulate the extreme craziness of Michael Bay golden era. It's all there: the helicopter crash, the endless slow mo, the Dutch angles, the two minutes of dialogues sandwiched between fifteen minutes of explosions and of course the louder-the bass-the-better soundtrack.<br/><br/>And guess what? It works. Mostly.<br/><br/>Yes the Justice Society is a bunch of cosplayers with zero back story or character development but with dodgy priorities and powers that we've seen already in many superheroes before. But the effects are bold and spectacular, the colors wild, the camera moves astonishing. Add to it Zack Snyder's sepia tones, men in sandal obsession and anime like fights scenes (they reminded me of the best of Man Of Steel) and you have a very convincing \"comic book to screen\" adaptation.<br/><br/>Of course with this many new characters without a very precise goal most of the time, you end up with logistic issues where they just disappear offscreen during a fight for a little while and show up neatly when they have to. But that's because they all know they have to leave the room for the Rock whose statuesque figure was born for destroying fictional cities and throwing villain soldiers in the sky. Yeah that's the one thing Michael Bay wouldn't approve, you don't disrespect the military like that!</div>\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">In the superhero movie genre I would rank this somewhere in the middle, which of course also means that this is a fantastic movie from a DC-perspective. DC have really been digging below the bottom of the barrel, and with only one exception every other single movie have been horrible.<br/><br/>This is not horrible. Actually this is kinda entertaining, it is fun, and the movie flies by in a very brisk pace. The more or less constant fighting is pretty great, and they even manage to get a few one-liners in there. Even the CGi is good (mostly), which can only mean that DC finally got rid of their awful special effects team.<br/><br/>But this is not really great either. This is a very single-minded kind of movie. Evil bla bla bla curse lots of slow-mo accompanied by superhero bombastic music and lots of crashing buildings, lots of disposable henchmen. Sure there is a underlaying theme of \"who is really a hero?\" and a few tiny tidbits of story, but mainly this is like a huge wrestling match with pretty unpretentious smashing. Since everything move so quickly we also have no time to breath or get to know these characters. I wish there was 20min more with some background stories, but nah, smash more, blow up more stuff, woosh, blam, slam.<br/><br/>If you have no intention of seeing anything but a big long slugfest with a lot of CGi and you do not care about story or character development, then you are likely going to love this. From that perspective, and from a DC perspective, this movie is pretty good, almost great. But if you weigh in actual movie value such as script, characters, and storytelling well... then not so much.<br/><br/>I give this a 7/10 just because I was entertained and since I am happy to see a DC film that do not suck like a boring black hole. But to be honest that score is too generous. Worth the ticket price though; so I recommend!</div>\n",

This was a very mediocre film, and felt like a very colour by numbers superhero film, designed and tested to please as many audiences as possible. Meaning it plays it safe and doesn't take any risks. But I enjoyed it, it's a very entertaining watch with lots of huge setpieces! In fact, once it gets going it doesn't stop... it's a non-stop, action-packed thrill ride! It's only problem - it's so average; something we've seen a million times before. It almost left me feeling a bit of superhero fatigue, as everything just felt recycled. I kept waiting for it to do something fresh and new, and while there were a few good moments, overall the movie was incredibly predictable. I even had moments wishing the action would slow down so we could get another dialogue scene or something that would flesh out the characters more. The script just isn't great, frankly. But it's still a good time. I think of it like this; Black Adam is a bad movie held together by some AWESOME moments!<br/><br/>So let's get these negatives out of the way. The script is extremely weak and very predictable, heck the trailers even spoiled a \"twist\" near the middle of the film. It's not hard to figure out what the movie is doing, especially for those of us who've seen a lot of these superhero movies over the years. It doesn't try all that hard to keep eventual reveals hidden, as it's more focused on giving its protagonist the flashiest, most murder-filled debut in the DCEU (even though I would look to \"The Suicide Squad\" for that). It really felt like the creative team saw Black Adam being an anti-hero as an excuse to let them have the character kill everyone. It felt so overplayed and obnoxious, like they were trying to say \"see look how brutal we can make this\" without actually earning the audience's investment. The scenes where Black Adam just goes around dominating everyone just felt empty, like sure it was cool to see him be so powerful and instantly kill people, but it took all the tension out of the scenes. It felt like they were beating me over the head with \"look how powerful and ruthless he is\". The novelty of it wore off very quickly too, so thank god the film introduces the Justice Society pretty quick! They did make the smart choice of making this equal parts a Justice Society film as they did a Black Adam film, and I gotta say while I did find the character of Black Adam quite interesting, it was the Justice Society (mainly Hawkman and Doctor Fate) that I loved!<br/><br/>It's when the Justice Society comes in that the movie remembers how fun exciting superhero stories can be. I enjoyed their part in the story the most, and instantly loved the characters. Pierce Brosnan's Doctor Fate was awesome, it was so cool to see Brosnan in a superhero role. He did feel a little reminiscent of a certain Marvel Doctor, but that's okay because they both have some COOL scenes; Fate had some of the most memorable in the film! Hawkman was also pretty badass, I really hope to see these characters again! And I gotta say, I did love Dwayne Johnson as Black Adam. He suits the role very well and I'd love to see this iteration of the character return. I'm just not sure how I feel about him in this movie. It makes him look cool and all, and Johnson's physique is perfect for the character, but he had almost no story. Like they introduced his backstory and everything, but once the movie got going it never stopped to examine his character; we never understood how he felt about anything, which made him just come across as an uncharming sociopath. This is especially unusual for Johnson, as we all know how undeniably charismatic he can be, and he just isn't here. But damn he sure is magnetic and does command the screen with his hulking form and brooding looks. The only cast members I didn't like, and this was more because of the way their characters were written, were Adrianna and her son. They really did not work for me and made some really dumb decisions throughout the movie, and had some very cringey scenes. But luckily that was only a minor part! There was some cool cameos too, surprisingly from James Gunn's \"The Suicide Squad\" and of course a certain cast member from \"Shazam!\". I did love these little connections- it's nice to see the DCEU try to be interconnected again! And the \"Shazam!\" stuff was awesome, it showed some things I wished we got to see in that movie! And how could I forget... There was one other cameo I did really love. It's definitely the worst kept secret in Hollywood... but made for an awesome end credit scene and made this fan very happy!<br/><br/>The filmmaking here is abysmal. Jaume Collet-Serra has never made a great movie, instead making B-level movies at the studio level... and this might just be proof he is not capable of directing films of this scale. He makes every moment feel mundane; from Black Adam going on a killing spree to the big fight between the JSA and Black Adam, these moments should feel engaging and cool, but instead just bored me, frankly. It feels like he is trying so hard to show spectacle, but he ultimately fails, making it all feel cheap and generic. I also couldn't stand the cinematography. It seems like they shot the film to look like Zack Snyder's \"300\", with bland colours and lots and lots of annoying slo-mo. At least the CGI was good! There were some moments that had their flaws, but overall this movie has some awesome CGI (and a seemingly obligatory CGI filled 3rd act). Don't even get me started on the truly awful sound mix, it just felt like sound was being blared in my face for 2 hours and I couldn't discern what I was hearing. It just sounded messy. The score isn't memorable, instead it just sounds like a jumble of notes and digital instrumentation, it has no emotional core to the music and it is just noise. Even the dialogue is not mixed well, but that's okay because the dialogue is horrendous anyways.<br/><br/>So why, after all that complaining, did I ultimately enjoy myself while watching? Well, because it has enough cool moments that I came out satisfied. I have never seen a movie so bad that I still enjoyed this much. It's remarkable how well a few moments and ideas can make for an enjoyable viewing experience. The disappointing part of this is, if only they put the good moments together in better ways this could have been an awesome film, but instead it misses so many opportunities. There was one moment that really stands out to me because it made me want to cheer however, and that was the awesome reference to \"The Good, The Bad and the Ugly\", I feel like many superhero fans will miss that reference, but for me as a cinephile that scene quickly became my favourite in the film! The film felt like it was made in the 90s, before the MCU, before X-Men, before superhero flicks became popular back when they were still trying to figure them out, it was just all over the place. And it also happened to be pretty derivative of other films- \"Avatar\", \"Black Panther\" and \"Captain America: The First Avenger\" especially. But despite all my issues I have with this film - and I have many - it somehow still managed to entertain me and leave me satisfied by the time it was over (possibly because of the awesome end-credit scene). It was kind of like \"Venom\"... just some mindless superhero fun! I wish it was a better movie because it did have some awesome elements, but as a film it ultimately fails. I would like to see more of Dwayne Johnson's \"Black Adam\", especially in a potential \"Black Adam v. Superman\" movie he keeps talking about! With some improvements, it could be a much better movie than this, while still being entertaining!</div>\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">I knew nothing of Black Adam going in so it was pretty cool to discover who he is and what he's about. This is a fast-paced and fun movie with some good action scenes. The musical score is great, and of course it's composed by beast Lorne Balfe who has become a star. I like the cast and was pretty happy with the 300-feel it gave me a few times.<br/><br/>This movie is also flawed. Not everything works. Much of the comedy doesn't hit. There is a bunch of basic dialogue. It's not a good sign when I can predict the next line multiple times.<br/><br/>There seems to be a LOT stolen from Marvel. I'm not a comic book guy and have no stakes in the Marvel vs DC debate. I don't know which of these characters were created first. But the four side-heroes are all analogous to Marvel characters we've already seen in movies for years. We have an Ant-man, a Doctor Strange, a Falcon and a Storm (sort of). I'll give them props for the last two possibly being cooler than their Marvel counterparts. But it wasn't just the characters, there were at least four moments that reminded me of something from a Marvel movie.<br/><br/>I tried not to let that factor into my feelings for the movie. And even with this slightly positive DC chapter, I continue to hope that DC can do better. I know they can. The Dark Knight trilogy is still GOAT and I love the first three movies after that. I really hope they can do better in the future. (1 viewing, opening Thursday UltraScreen 10/20/2022)</div>\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">\"Black Adam\" is the 11th film in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) and a spin-off from 2019's \"Shazam!\". Starring Dwayne Johnson in the title role, it delivers explosive action scenes with great special effects that should satisfy fans of the superhero genre.<br/><br/>Five thousand years after being bestowed with the power of ancient gods and then sealed away, Teth-Adam (Dwayne Johnson) is released from his prison in the modern day city of Kahndaq. Shocked at how much the world has changed, Adam goes on a rampage, brutally killing many hostile soldiers and other adversaries in the process. In an attempt to quell Adam's rage, the Justice Society of America (JSA), consisting of Doctor Fate (Pierce Brosnan), Cyclone (Quintessa Swindell), and Atom Smasher (Noah Centineo) set off for Kahndaq to halt this senseless destruction before it is too late.<br/><br/>Since his comic book debut back in 1945, Black Adam (a.k.a. Teth-Adam or Theo Adam) has been depicted as both a hero and a villain at various points. In recent years, however, he has been reworked as an anti-hero, retaining his violent streak while also wishing to help out the less fortunate wherever possible. The character's sudden acquisition of superpowers lends itself to the idea that owning such inhuman strength also runs the risk of misuse and corruption along with it. This concept certainly pushes the typical \"with great power comes great responsibility\" formula to the limits and in this 2022 film about the titular character, we now get to see that notion play out for us in live-action.<br/><br/>I have to admit it's quite refreshing to see a superhero film where its main character is neither good nor bad but rather a neutral party in all of this. So often in these types of stories we watch as our protagonist simply acquires his or her powers and immediately goes off to do heroic or villainous deeds without a second thought. Here, we get to see Black Adam come to terms with what powerful abilities he has unwillingly been given, undecided as to what allegiance he falls under. In one scene, we see Adam mercilessly slaughter armed soldiers one by one, literally reducing some of them to ashes but shortly afterwards he saves the lives of a young boy and his mother caught in the crossfire. The ambiguity as to whom Adam wants to protect versus whom he wants to kill becomes a common theme throughout the movie, which does a nice job of making you wonder what battles he's going to pick and choose.<br/><br/>To compliment these internalised conflicts, we also have some highly entertaining action scenes to go along with them. In addition to the aforementioned fights against soldiers, there's extensive gunfire and explosive weaponry frequently used against Adam during battle, of which proves futile in the end. These moments helped move the film along at a brisk pace, leaving little room for anything boring to transpire. Of course, as is usually the case in most superhero films, there is so much collateral damage left in the wake of scenes like these. As fun to watch as these parts were, I couldn't help but feel a little sorry for the poor people of Kahndaq as their city is subject to so much destruction throughout the chaos. It's just as well Kahndaq is a fictional place because I hate to imagine how costly it would be in real life to rebuild everything that was destroyed in the melee. This may seem like a trivial nitpick, but considering how ancient the city is supposed to be, it feels kind of painful to see so many things of historical value smashed to pieces for the sake of an action setpiece.<br/><br/>As the film is a spin-off from \"Shazam!\", one of the more amusing entries in the DC Extended Universe, there's also some light-hearted comic relief to ease the tension of certain serious scenes. While the jokes were rather hit-and-miss and didn't always land, the ones that did provided some much needed humorous moments, showing yet again that DC films are capable of being funny whenever they want to be. In particular, I liked the scenes where Adam tries to comprehend modern day lexicon when compared to how things were over five thousand years ago. I suppose it is similar to how Thor tried to blend in with the humans in the MCU, only this time with the more sinister undercurrent of Adam turning rogue at any time.<br/><br/>It seems long overdue that Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson play a superhero/supervillain in a comic book movie and now we finally get to see him do just that. Given his muscular physique, a character like Black Adam suits Johnson perfectly. It's great fun to see Johnson put his strength as a former wrestler to good use as he throws his enemies across ridiculous distances, not once caring where they might land. At the beginning, I half expected him to be constantly spouting lame one-liners and pulling weird reaction faces at strange scenarios, but for the most part Johnson plays the role very seriously. You certainly gain a solid understanding of why he doesn't consider himself neither good nor bad, which made his character a more compelling anti-hero. That's not to say he's always downbeat, because he definitely has his fair share of comical moments from time to time.<br/><br/>The rest of the supporting cast were decent, with Quintessa Swindell and Noah Centineo fitting in reasonably well as Cyclone and Atom Smasher, respectively, but only Pierce Brosnan as Doctor Fate left any lasting impression on me. His character appears to be the Doctor Strange of the DCEU (though Fate's comic debut predates Strange's creation by 23 years), summoning spells and incantations that allow him to stand head-to-head with Black Adam during his violent rampages. Unlike Strange, however, Fate doesn't have an inflated ego and is relatively level-headed and calm, much like a certain famous spy Brosnan has played in the past. To be fair though, Dwayne Johnson is a hard act to outshine due to his natural charisma so if there's any actor in this film who comes close, it would be the one who used to play James Bond.<br/><br/>Taking into consideration the current state of the DCEU, an entry like \"Black Adam\" doesn't really offer anything better or worse than what we've already experienced many times before. It works simply as an entertaining, action-packed, effects-driven superhero film that will hopefully keep fans happy for two whole hours. I am curious to see how Black Adam will be integrated among the other DC heroes, especially with the ones from \"Shazam!\", but for now he works just fine as a standalone character. However, judging by the mid-credits scene, things do look promising.<br/><br/>I rate it 7.5/10.</div>\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Black Adam is the latest film in the DCEU, and boy, it packs a punch. Explosions, flying superheroes, magic, lightning and beautiful armour follows the Justice Society, and of course Black Adam.<br/><br/>The film centers around a god-like ancient human being who was gifted his powers in a time of darkness and enslavement. After being defeated and unseen for over a 5000 years, he returns, his goal being unknown. With the powers he has a group of superheroes, the Justice Society, deems him to be a threat, and performs an attempt to lock him up, unknown of the real danger.<br/><br/>It is better than people say. Although at first glance it seems to be a film simply made for the action and explosions, it does have a story, strong dialogues and character development. The visual effects are astonishing in every single way, and people who have watched Avengers: Endgame will love the visuals in this film.<br/><br/>My personal rating? A 10/10. My rating based on realism, plot and other factors? An 8 or a 9/10. If I'm going to be honest, the worst thing about this film was some unrealism like characters being able to survive a lot more than possible, and some being quite dumb in terms of their actions.<br/><br/>As for my conclusion: Black Adam is a great, visually wonderful film with lots of action violence and lovable characters. Watch it in the cinema for a lifetime experience.</div>\n",

Action packed from start to finish. Aldis Hodge and Pierce Brosnan are phenomenal and the justice society of America makes it more fun and interesting(except cyclone). Hawkman,Black Adam are the badass in this film. Dwayne Johnson is really born to play this character and watch out for the mid credit scene!.<br/><br/>This is the movie for a great momentum for the future of DC universe.<br/><br/>At the negative side, villain is not intimidating and storyline is repetitive and there some cheesy scenes but overall this movie is a blast.<br/><br/>So excited for the future of dceu. 7.5/10.</div>\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">For a while here there's a sense that DC, on one of its few and far between occasions, has managed to deliver a feature film product worthy of its source material (and extensive budgets) with director Jaume Collet-Serra managing to start Black Adam in a fun and exciting fashion that seems to suggest audience goers were going to be treated to something a little unexpected, something just slightly amended from the usual playbook of initial superhero adventures but then all hope and excitement is extinguished by a teenage boy and his ever-present skateboard.<br/><br/>More on that later.<br/><br/>A much-hyped production that its leading man has been championing for the better part of the last few years, Black Adam presents DC with one of its greatest chances yet to bring one of its more complicated creations to screen and while his natural charisma (that you either love or hate) is mainly squashed in a role that brings to mind Arnie from Terminator 2, Dwayne Johnson fits the bill to be our anti-hero Teth Adam but despite some impressively staged early action scenes and a narrative that doesn't always play to the rules set out for large blockbuster origin stories such as this, Black Adam is unable to keep the foot on the gas as some questionable narrative decisions and character inclusions halt much of the films progress in being a silly but fun popcorn munching ride.<br/><br/>There are times here when you forget you're watching a Black Adam film with Bodhi Sabongui and Sarah Shahi's Kahndaq natives Adrianna and Amon Tomaz joining Adam's journey as he awakens from a 5000 year slumber to all of a sudden be battling unknown forces and Aldis Hodge's Hawkman led Justice Society, with these two characters playing large roles in proceedings to an extent they become a genuine annoyance and by the time Amon is rallying local citizens in one of the most cringe-worthy battle cries committed to celluloid before leading a charge on his beloved skateboard you know that Black Adam has failed to hit the mark.<br/><br/>These glaringly non-important characters and plot diversions do in some ways mask other problems that become more apparent as Black Adam's runtime wears on with Collet-Serra's insistence on including either a blasting musical score or Spotify 101 pump up songs in all of his abundant slow-mo action scenes or a collection of underdeveloped characters that includes the films main villain and Justice Society members Atom Smasher and Cyclone other reasons why the film fails to go on with its various moments of promise, with one almost wishing we were allowed more time to get to know Adam or even Pierce Brosnan's Dr. Fate/Kent Nelson, who steals many of the films best scenes with one hoping the veteran screen actor gets a chance to shine in a solo outing in the near future.<br/><br/>To be fair to all involved, Black Adam is far from the worst DC movie to come our way but in regards to promise and potential verses the final outcome, this loud, colourful and soulless outing is equivalent to the likes of Man of Steel and Suicide Squad as features that seemed to be set to shine only for poor decisions and weak directive decisions hampering any chance they had of shining on the big stage.<br/><br/>Final Say -<br/><br/>Not without its moments, Black Adam is hampered by an increasingly painful plot-line and even worse supporting characters that take away from the films early signs that it is looking to do something a little different than the usual origin story run-through.<br/><br/>2 1/2 skateboards out of 5.<br/><br/>Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)</div>\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Director Juame Collet-Serra's extensive experience helming thriller films is quite evident here; the action-while not particularly distinctive-is more than sufficiently hard-hitting, gleefully destructive, and thrilling to keep the film from ever becoming dull.<br/><br/>That's quite the achievement, because on paper Black Adam is a largely dull exercise. It's entirely derivative of other, better superhero films, and is without an ounce of any sense of originality in what it delivers to this corpse of a genre.<br/><br/>The film has a villain who is never really introduced until the final act and is laughably cartoonish. He's a punching bag for the characters to have something to fight at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>The ordinary mortal characters are just as lifeless. Most of the people in this movie aren't actual living, breathing human beings, but plot devices.<br/><br/>That being said, The Rock's titular character of Black Adam is actually handled surprisingly well. His background of tragedy is thoroughly explored (even though it's through clunky narration exposition dumps), and does undergo tangible internal change over the course of the story.<br/><br/>Adam's change in self-image has moderately thought-provoking implications as he comes to realise that his past failures don't determine currency worthiness.<br/><br/>This is one of only two bright spots in the writing, along with watching Adam and Hawkman clash in their worldviews/opinions of justice.<br/><br/>I really do wish that these bright spots made up more of the movie. Because the entire plot is constructed solely of story beats and objects and antagonists who have not only been seen before, but have been seen before so often-and exactly in this way-that they've been beaten more than any deceased horse.<br/><br/>Consequently, it's a sometimes charming, largely competent exercise in rote rehash.</div>\n",

I didn't really have any expectations for this movie, as the only real knowledge I have about the character comes from the Injustice video game series. However, Black Adam takes all the elements of bad superhero flicks and crams them into one loud &amp; messy movie. While it does have some exciting action sequences, it also had too many characters, not enough backstory, heavy-handed messages, bad acting, forced humor, sloppy editing, awful dubbing, and an overreliance on CGI. I spent the first half of the movie confused, and the second half annoyed.</div>\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Was anybody really excited about Black Adam? Maybe there are people who were, but as for myself and the people I know, Black Adam was just yet another superhero movie in an unending line of superhero movies; all the same with nothing new or fresh to offer. But still, as is custom, I had to go check this movie out because Sri Lanka's roster of theater releases aren't that great, so I'll take whatever comes.<br/><br/>Black Adam ended up being sometimes funny, a little more than sometimes cringe, and extremely mid. It's a movie with the most generic stakes ever, and with nothing new to add to a genre that has been the same for the past few years. The only aspect I personally enjoyed in the movie was Pierce Brosnan, and sometimes The Rock, but everything else fell flat. Especially whatever the writers tried to do with the Amon character. Things couldn't have been more generic than that.<br/><br/>Overall, is it a bad movie? Far from it. Is it good? NO. Should you watch it? Well, you wouldn't be missing anything if you didn't.</div>\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Black Adam is a superhero movie's superhero movie: and it seems like critics and audiences (even though they're both one and the same most of the time) are becoming evermore divided on what one group thinks about the productions in question. Yes the film's cliched, yes the characters don't exactly have depth to them through most of the movie, yes the CGI evokes Star-Wars-Prequel-Trilogy-Ragdoll-Physics or 2000s-Ragdoll-Physics, but Dwayne Johnson is such an entertainingly stoic action-man that it's like he's playing an unironic parody of action movies that it just goes with the flow of its own self-aware sense of Hollywood-isms.<br/><br/>Black Adam is an origin story, a team-up movie, a villain showcase, and somewhat confused in its fan-service like the LITERAL POSTERS of the Wonder Woman movie, Batman-comic-accurate-artwork, Superman merchandise, Injustice toys (from the video games), and the Suicide-Squad-style intro to our supporting characters makes you wonder... is DC Films self-aware of its success AND shortcomings in the past, and is just throwing everything into a blender with these shared-universe movies? If so: interesting choice. It doesn't work for 'serious cinema' necessarily, but it's a nice approach that can certainly be refined. Just... have the fourth-wall-breaking-fan-service make sense in the story; please?<br/><br/>Anywho: Black Adam has FINALLY been released after years of false-starts, Tweets, and studio-reshuffling to make even seasoned studio executives perplexed, and 2022 has Black Adam... breaking away from Shazam entirely. The two were originally gonna be in the Shazam! Movie. Makes you wonder if it should've stayed that way? At least they're finally in cinema: and now they can breathe in sequels I suppose.<br/><br/>This movie may not be what some of the fans are expecting, but the fan-service on display does work (when it makes sense) and the action can be a sight to behold, and the leading man himself knows how to rock the spandex look absolutely. The screenplay is a confused mess scared of the antihero theme making 'The Rock' look like a villain; so they sprinkle conflicted protagonist and boom, Black Adam's now a superhero. 3/5 stars.<br/><br/>For all that doesn't work in the film, the stuff that does keeps it from becoming downright tedious thankfully. When it's action-heavy it's action-heavy. With the fan service it's going all the way when it can. Just don't expect the story to break your minds or something. It's fairly straightforward stuff: and maybe that's what is bothering the critics.</div>\n",

Literally poor direction , most of place felt rushed , clumsy and incomplete . Action sequence was topnotch , with good choreography and marvelous visuals . Humor worked well in few places . More than Black Adam we can only see Dwayne Johnson . Comparing to others Doctor Fate was pretty impressive . Antagonist didn't create much impact . Cast done their job well . Technically , VFXs and cinematography were good , editing was average .<br/><br/>Overall a jus watch it for action sequence and mid credit scene 🔥 , if you can digest some cringe .</div>\n",

However, as the Rock was the star of this one I thought I would try it out. Dwayne Johnson is one of those none actors like Arnie before him who seem to play themselves in every movie but yet it works. So what would the Rock add to Black Adam?<br/><br/>Sadly not much, I am afraid I found this bad boy anti-hero dull and uninteresting and I was yawning for the end long before the final round of action stuff which as we all know the good guys always win, but could they not do it in a neat 90 minutes but at least this one was over in 124 though it felt much more like 180. One more observation I thought much of the special effects looked distinctly average perhaps this is a budget, superhero.<br/><br/>If it cost $100 million it must be Hollywood inflation. I love the movies at the movies, and so I will be back but not for Black Adam 2 but for the next hopefully decent Dwayne Johnson action movie.</div>\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Black Adam (2022) is a movie my wife and I saw in theaters last night. This storyline follows an ancient being known as Black Adam awaken within some ancient ruins. There is a race to find a historical crown that contains demon powers that is tied to how Black Adam gained his powers. As Black Adam's chaos begins he gains the attention of the Justice Society that will try to contain Black Adam while also thwarted the evil doers trying to get the crown. The question becomes which side will Black Adam take, the side of the evil doers or join forces with the Justice Society?<br/><br/>This movie is directed by Jaume Collet-Serra (Orphan) and stars Dwayne Johnson (The Rundown), Aldis Hodge (Hidden Figures), Pierce Brosnan (Tomorrow Never Dies) and Mohammed Amer (Mo).<br/><br/>It's impossible not to like a super hero movie with this many kill scenes. The Rock is absolutely awesome as Black Adam and his kill scenes are tremendous as are the running jokes tied to the killings. The comedic content overall is pretty solid. The special effects are tremendous and I enjoyed the inclusion of the Justice Society. Aldis Hodge delivers a strong performance as does Jalon Christian (A Journal for Jordan). The storyline is intricate and has some fun twists and turns and I enjoyed the conclusion. The post credits scenes is absolutely awesome too.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a very well done addition to the super hero genre with enough unique elements to make it a must see. I would score this a strong 7.5-8/10 and strongly recommend it.</div>\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">Admittedly far from impressive, doesn't reinvent the wheel and writing wasn't so great, but I loved it still. My feelings kept changing before it's release, compared to the days I was excited for it, it didn't deliver as much, but if compared to the days I was scared it was gonna flop then Black Adam was actually way better than my expectations.<br/><br/>The first scenes of the movie are great, sorta reminds me of mythical movies like clash of the titans or Hercules in which Dwayne Johnson featured in too. Not many movies like that being made, we went from gladiator movies to Greek god movies, somewhere in between had Egyptian mummies and now we're in a superhero phase. Still think superhero movies are awesome fun, even better when done right but I loved gods and mythical movies, and this puts them both together.<br/><br/>It has an almost dark ambience to it but is still visually stunning with Cyclone and Atom smasher giving it a more prismatic feel. They also had a little side plot going that actually didn't get anywhere. Compared to other recent movies, I love that Black Adam's origin was handled in a God Butcher-esque way, it was dark enough to still keep it dark while still keeping a pg13 rating which I thought should've been higher before release.<br/><br/>It also blends Black Adam's Bronze Age origins and magic with future tech. If you're more of a fan of the cinematic universes and don't really read the comics, the movie does it's best to give you a background introduction, but because of this the first part of the movie feels rushed because it's a lot to condense into the start. Don't really read the comics so I don't know if they did Black Adam's character justice for the comic fans.<br/><br/>Adams intro in the movie so good, and his main adversary's was even better later on, actually devilish. I love how when DC super-powers someone, they really go for it and people really hated it with Henry Cavil's Superman. I love the idea of them potentially getting into a brawl in the future.<br/><br/>Action is superb once it starts, delivers on expectations although the movie almost leans a lot on it's action. I also recommend avoiding spoilers and trailers as I did. Loved how Black Adam's sternness is written to some comedic effect at times, I often say Hollywood shouldn't try making every new superhero movie into a joke show and they kept it in a low here.<br/><br/>Dwayne Johnson was great and did his character justice, so did Pierce Brosnan as Dr fate, I think Noah Centineo and Quintessa Swindell suffered from being underwritten side characters due to so much plot and other characters the movie had to fit in, so they didn't get as much time to shine. If there was an award for most cameos in the same movie... I also feel like black Adam was written perfectly but at the end started making mannerisms that broke from his character, like the smirking and smiles.<br/><br/>The actual problems I had with the movie were once the premise is revealed the story progresses generically, so you can pretty much figure out where the story is going. It's pretty formulaic and the story narration wasn't something to behold. For that reason, as much as I still love it, it's not as good as it could've been, it does deliver on shifting the power dynamics in the dceu though. And with all the great action and cast coupled with decent story, it's still a fun watch. Secondly, something I rarely say, it could've been better if it was longer to let the story develop and add depth; because it has the makings of a great movie and really finds it's footing in the third act but then blitzes quickly through it to the end.<br/><br/>And it promises a lot for the future, I hope future DC movies are more coherent like what MCU does by making their movies relate, not just having heroes cameoing in other heroes movies then bunching them all together. This could be a great start to a phase in the DC universe, could argue it started with Shazam but you get it.<br/><br/>It's imperfect and has wiggle room for improvement but I love it and would recommend seeing it on the big screen. Deadpool has been my favorite antihero for a long time and is a whole different character but I think black Adam's taking that spot now. I loved the movie for Black Adam's character himself.</div>\n",

Adding some ethnic flavor to his accent would've paid off mightily.<br/><br/>Carrying echoes of Snyder but with the treatments and levity of the Wonder Woman and Aquaman entries to the DCEU, Black Adam hits the right notes and solidifies that the DCEU is alive and well.<br/><br/>Unless you've been living under a rock, make sure to stick around for the post-credit scene.<br/><br/>Solid 8/10.</div>\n",

The same Snyder-esque template (endless slow mo, dirty/dark palette). Dr. Fate copies literally every move from Dr. Strange. Hawkman annoying as hell with his bland brand of \"leadership\".

A simple entertaining film if you're able to see past some of its obvious faults. The action really felt like it was trying to be Zack Snyder lite, which partially works because it only tries to be lite in using that style even though the movie itself is action-packed. The characters are very forgettable although the performances of Pierce Brosnan, Aldis Hodge and the rest of the Justice Society members gives some life to it. The music was very underwhelming for me especially because it tries to elevate scenes by becoming loud and noticeable without making any impact.<br/><br/>Black Adam is supposed to be an antihero but with a star like The Rock, he is only a reluctant hero who doesn't mind killing. Overall just a watchable film if you're a fan of the superhero genre.</div>\n",

This is a movie I probably won't remember at all in the near future. Too much slo-mo and lack of fun. Pierce Brosnan was probably the highlight as he gives the film a little bit of a spark to the cast of characters.<br/><br/>Otherwise very dull characters which you care little about, wonky special effects in places and humour which doesn't work most of the time.

I always wondered why Black Adam? Not just an obscure Comic book character amongst DC's finest but why not just play his best rival SHAZAM and truly be a black superhero?<br/><br/>I have to say, I'm so happy he picked Black Adam. Mostly because Dwayne Johnson playing a \"Villain\" met that superheroes would have to try to stop him, and they made the decision to...extend the DC Extended Universe with heroes that have not grace the silver screen yet.<br/><br/>Aldis Hodge playing a cross between Batman and Black Panther with his version of Hawkman. The special effects to bring Atom Smasher to life were amazing, now I know who Cyclone is (I wonder if she's an actual black woman in the comic), and Pierce Brosnan, who could have been my generation's Batman, is playing Dr. Faith. Forming together to become the Justice Society and me hoping this will not be the last I see of them.<br/><br/>Black Adam was good it was really good, absolutely worth the time and effort. The DC Extended universe has made some questionable movies, but this is not one of them. This was Aquaman, Wonder Woman good. This was SHAZAM good, and that's hope that battle with Black Adam is coming up!<br/><br/>Excellent!!</div>\n",

       " <div class=\"text show-more__control\">\"The new era\" for the DCEU is here, but sadly, it's not quite the jump in quality the cinematic universe truly needed.<br/><br/>The introduction of Black Adam is flawed as many of the previous DCEU movies have been, and there are no notable changes in direction that make it stick out in its own way. The movie fails to find a unique mark and doesn't really have anything interesting to say.<br/><br/>If everything you want from a superhero movie is the action, you got it, also sometimes the CGI feels overused. Try to go any deeper than that, and there's not much else to be found.<br/><br/>Best part of the movie must be Brosnan's Doctor Fate, but he can't carry the whole movie just by the look of his character. There needs to be a story...a good one, which is missing here.<br/><br/>There's not much that can be said about the film's villain, Sabbac, without spoiling the film. However, even if spoilers weren't an issue, there's still basically nothing interesting to say about him.<br/><br/>Even with all that said, given how big Dwayne Johnson is and how much power he seems to have over the franchise (and now the DCEU as well), fans should expect Black Adam to carry on in a big way going forward for better or for worse. New hierarchy they said? Yeah. No.</div>\n",

It has everything you need for a super hero movie.<br/><br/>A great cast. In particular Pierce Brosnan. It's good to see him return to the big screen in such an iconic role.<br/><br/>An original script.<br/><br/>Amazing action scenes.<br/><br/>You can tell that the movie was more than ten years in the making based on its attention to detail in the production. Starting from the special effects up to the costume designs.<br/><br/>I don't know much about the original comic or the DC universe in general. But I love the idea of an anti-hero saving the world on its own terms. This grittier and darker approach totally works for me and could be a door opener for a whole new sub-genre.

       " \"Black Adam is not without its flaws, but i still enjoy the hell out of it, the problem that i have with Black Adam is that i never really buy all the Kahndaq people 100%, in the end i only still buy half of it, but i still fine with it, it's not like their characters are terrible, it just most of the time they are doing just a poor performance except the actress who played the mom and probably Ishmael for the most part, at least i still got some of the laughs from one of them, some of the slower scene was sometimes misplaced including some of the flashback, and some nit picky here and there, the rest of Black Adam is an exciting comic book film that fills with a very impressive battle that also fills with dazzling visual and cool style, Black Adam himself played incredibly well by Dwayne Johnson, he was just unstoppable in the most badass way, Justice Society has just become one of my favorite superhero team specifically in movies, they are fun and they are great, Hawkman, Doctor Fate, Cyclone, and Atom Smasher all of them are a hit for me, i love every single one of them, though i do wish they have something more with Doctor Fate because i think Pierce Brosnan was just unbelievably good playing the characters, again at least we do still have that one moment, i would love to see Justice Society again in movie maybe even their own movie, i would also love to have a specifically Doctor Fate standalone or a prequel film, and last but not least, the main villain, i think the main villain is doing as fine as most of the hero in the movie, so overall Black Adam is a quite a fun ride, 2 hours did feel quite goes by, an exciting back and forth battle that fills with dazzling visual effect and style, great score, great sound, great performances for most of the cast, being the first original DCEU movie that release in theaters only since WW84, Black Adam is not perfect but it's still great, it's still fun, it's still fascinating, it's still exciting, and i enjoy the hell out of it.\"]"
